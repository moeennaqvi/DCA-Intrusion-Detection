# Intrusion Detection using Dendritic Cell algorithm
This project implements the Dendritic Cell algorithm for KDD 99 Cup Challenge dataset and performs a binary classification. 

## Instructions: 
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Open the `/notebook` directory.
4. Locate the file named `Dendritic cell Algorithm.ipynb`.
5. Open `Dendritic cell Algorithm.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any other compatible notebook environment.
6. Follow the instructions and code snippets in the notebook to implement the credit analysis and prediction project.
